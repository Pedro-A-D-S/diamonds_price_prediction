# SERVER CONFIGURATION -------------------

# `mlflow_tracking_uri` is the path where the runs will be recorded.
# For more informations, see https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#where-runs-are-recorded
# kedro-mlflow accepts relative path from the project root.
# For instance, default `mlruns` will create a mlruns folder
# at the root of the project

# All credentials needed for mlflow must be stored in credentials .yml as a dict
# they will be exported as environment variable
# If you want to set some credentials,  e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# > in `credentials.yml`:
# your_mlflow_credentials:
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: 132456
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: 132456
# > in this file `mlflow.yml`:
# credentials: mlflow_credentials

# UI-RELATED PARAMETERS -----------------

ui:
  port: "5000" # the port to use for the ui. Use mlflow default with 5000.
  host: "127.0.0.1"  # the host to use for the ui. Use mlflow default of "127.0.0.1".
